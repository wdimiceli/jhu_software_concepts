# Module 1: Personal Website

This is a very straightforward Flask app that renders a personal homepage, a "contact me" page, and a page that showcases the semester's projects.

## Requirements

* Python 3.10+

<small>_The codebase was developed on OSX 15.6.1.  Compatible systems should work, however the setup instructions may differ for Windows._</small>

## Getting started

To run the app, first set up your environment and install the package dependencies:

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, execute the `run.py` script:

```sh
python run.py
```

Flask should confirm the app is running and print

> `* Running on http://127.0.0.1:8080`

to your terminal. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to begin browsing the app.
